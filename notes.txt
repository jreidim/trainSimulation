Simulation Algorithm:

For each time t from 0 to SimulationTime:
    if, next train arrives (t == next arriving train):
        add to line queue and print info

    if, dock is empty:
        if, line is empty:
            pass
        else:
            move next train in line to dock
    else:
        if dock is not hogged:
            if, remaining crew hours <= 0:
                hog the train
                request new crew, 12hr clock starts now

            else:
                remaining unload time goes down
        if dock is hogged:
            if, new crew arrival time == t:
                unhog the train
                remaing unload time goes down
        remaining crew time goes down
