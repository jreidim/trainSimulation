Simulation Algorithm:

For each time t from 0 to SimulationTime:
    if, next train arrives (t == next arriving train):
        add to line queue and print info

    if, dock is empty:
        if, line is empty:
            pass
        else:
            if next train is not hogged:
                move next train in line to dock
            else:
                wait
    else:
        if dock is not hogged:
            if docked train is finished unloading:
                process next in line

            else if, remaining crew hours <= 0:
                hog the train
                request new crew, 12hr clock starts now

            else:
                remaining unload time goes down
        if dock is hogged:
            if, new crew arrival time == t:
                unhog the train
                remaining unload time goes down

        for every crew in line:
            remaining crew time goes down
            if crew reaches end of work hours:
                hog the train in line
                request replacement crew


 
bug: when docked train hoggs our during service, and the next train in line hogs out
    the docked train will never get it's replacement
